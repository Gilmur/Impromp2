## But why?

Discord channels can get very messy very quickly. With the inability to categorize properly and with the vast amount of games out right now it is very easy to find yourself with 25 different channels that get used rarely.

Impromp2 allows you to type a simple chat command and instantly create a temporary channel that only exists as long as it has had recent activity. Feeling even lazier? Impromp2 will also automatically create a temporary voice channel when a certain amount of people are all playing the same game at the same time.

## Who is it for?

* Those who love Discord but hate that it doesn't have the same temporary channel functionality as Curse.
* Streamers / Server Managers / Moderators / People with commitment Issues / Anybody who uses Discord
